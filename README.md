# AWS Terraform Module

## Overview
An AWS Terraform module is a self-contained package of Terraform configurations that are designed to set up a particular resource or a collection of related resources and services within AWS (Amazon Web Services). Terraform, by HashiCorp, is an infrastructure as code tool that allows users to define both cloud and on-premises resources in human-readable configuration files that can be versioned, reused, and shared.

## Key Features
### 1. Modularity: 
By packaging configurations into modules, complex systems can be broken down into more manageable components.
### 2. Reusability: 
Modules can be written once and used multiple times across different projects or environments to provision the same resources.
### 3. Maintainability: 
When updates or changes are required, they can be made centrally within the module, affecting all instances where the module is called.
### 4. Versioning: 
Modules can be versioned, ensuring that dependent configurations can rely on specific, predictable iterations of the module.

## Components
### 1. Input Variables: 
Allow customization of the module so it can be adapted for various scenarios without altering the module's underlying source code.
### 2. Resources: 
The main component of the module which defines the AWS resources that will be created or managed.
### 3. Outputs: 
Expose certain values from the moduleâ€™s resources to be easily queried or integrated with other parts of your Terraform configuration.
### 4. Modules: 
A module can call other modules, allowing you to create a complex hierarchy or a layered architecture.


By leveraging AWS Terraform modules, organizations can streamline their infrastructure provisioning workflow, promote best practices through reusability, and maintain infrastructure efficiency and reliability.
